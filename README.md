Hello, and welcome to pH to Amino Acid!

The purpose of this project is to act as a web app that can find out amino acids from pKa values (that are calculated to find isoelectric points) and in addition also create titration curves based on user data and also preordained values. This will allow a user to essentially run an experiment based off randomized samples and create a titration curve that ideally will be able to identify possible amino acids in the sample.

In order to run this webpage statically - a user could download the current repo and be able to use the website off their local machines. However, the webpage will also be available through a web server and will also utilize AWS - EC2, VPC, and S3 Buckets. (http://ph2amino.com)


Work Schedule:

Week 1:
- created AWS static website and tested Hello World command, and made tabs with the experiment copied and pasted in it to test (3 hours)
- got domain and HTTP set up (15 mins)
- I got reacclimated with Python, and read up on HTML/JS (2.5 hour)
- created dynamic server for AWS, going to try to break it next week (1 hour)

Week 2:
- Got information on all 20 amino acid and formed about 10 of their protonation charts (9 hours)
- worked on the backend pseudocode for the program to tell amino acids from just the pKas, will also add in an area to put how many buffer zones there are in the titration to help narrow down amino acid identification (2 hours)

Week 3:
- Completed 18/20 amino acid protonation structures and information (7 hours)
- wrote code for pkas (ie the simple version) (2 hours)

Week 4:
- Finished all protonation charts
- Tested isolated program for pKas, put together readme info
