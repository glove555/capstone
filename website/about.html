            Familiarity with amino acid chemistry including pKa values, pI values and protonation states is important for every
            biochemist. The protonation states of amino acids are important for understanding enzymatic catalysis, pH induced
            conformational changes, and the intermolecular interactions which stabilize the tertiary and quaternary structure of
            proteins.

            Creating a titration curve for a weak acid, such as phosphoric acid or an amino acid is a typical undergraduate
            laboratory experiment.Titration curves are obtained when the pH of a given volume of a sample solution varies after successive
            addition of acid or alkali/basic. The curves are usually plots of pH against the volume of titrant added or more correctly against
            the number of equivalents added per mole of the sample. The titration curve of an amino acid empirically defines several
            characteristics. The precise number of each characteristic depends on the nature of the amino acid being titrated:
            1) the number of ionizing groups
            2) the pKa of the ionizing group(s)
            3) the buffer region(s)
        </p>

            Each of these amino acids has a different side chain chemistry, but all
            of the amino acids have an acidic group (—COOH) and a basic group (NH2 )
            attached to the α carbon. The strong positive charge on the amino group
            induces a tendency for the carboxylic acid group to lose a proton. Some amino
            acids—such as the ones in this experiment—contain ionizable groups in their
            side chains that also act as weak acids or bases, giving off or taking on protons
            when the pH is altered. The dissociation of protons proceeds in a certain order
            which depends on the acidity of the proton: the one which is most acidic and
            having a lower pKa will dissociate first. So, typically the H+ on the α-COOH
            group (pKa1 ) will dissociate before that on the α-NH3 group (pKa2 ). This is
            because the resonance delocalization of charge on the carboxylic acid group
            stabilizes the conjugate base anion, whereas the amino group does not exhibit resonance stabilization

        <p>
            Titrate 25mL of 20 mM of each amino acid. The overal grams needed for each will depend on the molar mass of the amino acid unless they are similar (ex. 155.1 g/mol for histidine, 146.2 g/mol for lysine, 146.1
            g/mol for glutamine and 147.1 g/mo for glutamic acid). Most professors tend to use amino acids similar in mass, meaning the same number of grams will be used of each. If this is not the case - please calculate amount of grams needed of amino acid.
        </p>
        <p>
            Callibrate the pH meter, then bring the pH of each amino acid solution to 2 using 60 mM HCl. Add 1 mL aliquot of 50 mM NaOH. 
        </p>
        
        <p>Determine the equivalent OH for each volume of NaOH added to the amino acid solution (Hint: this will be the number found by dividing the moles of the unknown amino acid and the titrant NaOH.) </p>

        <p>Moles can be found by multiplying the volume of a solution in liters and its concentration in molar (M).</p>

        <p>In your spreadsheet of choice, make your first column the volume of NaOH added (mL), your second column Equivalents of OH- found from the last step, and finally in your third column the Unknown Amino Acid pH that you find from your titration.</p>

        <p>As a reference it should look something like this:</p>
