	<p> Familiarity with amino acid chemistry including pKa values, pI values and protonation states is important for every
biochemist. The protonation states of amino acids are important for understanding enzymatic catalysis, pH induced
conformational changes, and the intermolecular interactions which stabilize the tertiary and quaternary structure of
proteins.</p>

<p>Creating a titration curve for a weak acid, such as phosphoric acid or an amino acid is a typical undergraduate
laboratory experiment.Titration curves are obtained when the pH of a given volume of a sample solution varies after successive
addition of acid or alkali/basic. The curves are usually plots of pH against the volume of titrant added or more correctly against
the number of equivalents added per mole of the sample. The titration curve of an amino acid empirically defines several
characteristics. The precise number of each characteristic depends on the nature of the amino acid being titrated:
1) the number of ionizing groups
2) the pKa of the ionizing group(s)
3) the buffer region(s)
</p>

<p>Each of these amino acids has a different side chain chemistry, but all
of the amino acids have an acidic group (—COOH) and a basic group (NH2 )
attached to the α carbon. The strong positive charge on the amino group
induces a tendency for the carboxylic acid group to lose a proton. Some amino
acids—such as the ones in this experiment—contain ionizable groups in their
side chains that also act as weak acids or bases, giving off or taking on protons
when the pH is altered. The dissociation of protons proceeds in a certain order
which depends on the acidity of the proton: the one which is most acidic and
having a lower pKa will dissociate first. So, typically the H+ on the α-COOH
group (pKa1 ) will dissociate before that on the α-NH3 group (pKa2 ). This is
because the resonance delocalization of charge on the carboxylic acid group
stabilizes the conjugate base anion, whereas the amino group does not exhibit resonance stabilization </p>
